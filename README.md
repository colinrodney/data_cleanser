# Data Cleaning Automation with Python (pandas)

This project demonstrates how I help businesses clean, normalize, and prepare messy data files using Python and the **pandas** library.  

Messy CSVs and Excel exports are a common problem for small businesses, CRMs, and eCommerce tools.  
This tool **automates** the process, saving hours of manual work.
